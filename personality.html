        <h1>My Personality Traits</h1>
        <p>Some of my strongest traits are:</p> 
            <h3> My determination</h3>
                <p>I am very determined, which motivates me to keep working hard even when 
                    the material becomes overwhelming.  This trait keeps me focused on my 
                    goals and drives me to complete tasks on time, regardless of how difficult they are.
                    What I loathe even more than having a deadline is missing one, so I make it a point 
                    to prepare wisely, manage my time effectively, and maintain discipline in order 
                    to meet every commitment.</p>
            <h3> My Creativity</h3>
                    <p>I appreciate discovering new ways to tackle problems, whether through code or writing.
                        My inventiveness makes academic work more exciting because I approach projects with 
                        new ideas and views. This helps me to create and present tasks that reflect my 
                        individuality and stand out. I also adore sewing and hemming my clothes, 
                        as well as working with my hands on projects like nails and hair. 
                        These hobbies improve my patience, attention to detail, and capacity to 
                        concentrate on tasksâ€”skills that directly benefit my academic life and 
                        help me manage assignments with care and precision.</p>
            <h3> My Resilience</h3>
                    <p> I can bounce back fast from obstacles or setbacks because I am resilient. 
                        This keeps me motivated in the classroom when I have challenging projects 
                        or run across challenging ideas in classes like programming. 
                        I see challenges as chances to grow and learn rather than as reasons to give up. 
                        Because of my resilience, I am also able to manage a variety of obligations, 
                        including personal projects, hobbies like netball, and academics, without being distracted or giving up.</p>

    <!--My Hero--> 
    <section>
        <h2>My hero</h2>
        <p>Growing up, everyone around me had heroes. Classmates had their parents as their hero, had movie characters, 
            had celebrities as their hero, and then there were me. I couldn't think of anyone, and for the longest while 
            I struggled with who my hero was. Fast forward to a few years, my hero was my mom. Her resilience and her 
            strength in overcoming things. But then it changed to my aunt, and it remained with her for some time. 
            I admire the way she walks through life with her head held high, her shoulders back, with a smile so bright. 
            She tackles her day-to-day task with confidence. But now, my aunt isn't my hero anymore. <i>My hero is <b>ME</b></i>. 
            I admire the way I walk through day-to-day life, even when struggling with the smile on my face. I admire the way 
            tackle and overcome the emotions of depression. </p>
            <p>But, if I am to be true, tomorrow my hero may change.</p>

    <!--AI Business Report-->
    <h2>AI-Powered Fashion Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Among the unique AI-driven business ideas for 2025, AI-powered fashion recommendations stand out as a game changer 
      in the fashion industry.  This technology uses artificial intelligence to deliver personalized outfit ideas, which 
      improves the shopping experience by catering to individual interests and needs.</p>
      <h2>Real-World Examples & How they Apply in my life</h2>
      <p>In my daily life, AI-powered fashion recommendations can act as a virtual stylist, suggesting curated outfits 
        based on my particular style, body shape, and occasion.  For example, platforms like Ralph Lauren's "Ask Ralph" 
        use AI to recommend outfits for specific situations, such as a fall wedding or a casual outing
        (<a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/askralphinfo?msockid=15baab0a3eba61f514d3be363aba6366">Ask Ralph Download link</a>).
      In a similar vein, apps such as Doppl allow users to virtually put on clothing, giving them an accurate idea of how it might 
      fit and seem (<a href="https://labs.google/doppl">Doppl download link</a>).</p>
      <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
      <p>While posing many benefits, AI in fashion has numerous ethical concerns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bias and Fairness: </strong>If not correctly developed, AI systems have the potential to perpetuate existing biases.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Privacy: </strong>Personal data must be collected and used in a transparent and consent-based manner.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainability: </strong>The promotion of rapid fashion may contribute to environmental deterioration.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Adressing the Ethical Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bias Mitigation: </strong>To minimize biases, train AI on various datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency and Consent: </strong>Clearly notify users about data gathering methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable Practices: </strong>Encourage environmentally friendly and ethically manufactured clothing.</li>
      </ul>
