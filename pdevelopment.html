                <div class = "section-title">Summary</div>
                <p>The significance of establishing specific goals is emphasized in this chapter. 
                    Without objectives, people float aimlessly through life, according to Jim Rohn. 
                    Goals provide meaning to life and aid in tracking growth. They also promote perseverance 
                    and discipline.</p>
                <div class = "section-title">Reflection</div>
                <p>This chapter serves as a reminder to me that I need to set specific goals in order to succeed in my academics and job. 
                    For instance, I can establish concrete goals like "finish three coding projects this semester" or "master web programming 
                    before exams" rather to just saying, "I want to be good at programming."  I'll be able to monitor my progress and maintain 
                    motivation even in the face of overwhelming circumstances.</p>

                <div class = "section-title">Summary</div>
                <p>According to the chapter, time is one of the most precious resources since it can never be recovered 
                    once it is lost. Time is wisely managed by successful people, who prioritize tasks rather than 
                    squandering hours on unimportant things. Finding a balance between work, personal growth, and 
                    relaxation is crucial.</p>
                <div class = "section-title">Reflection</div>
                <p>I occasionally catch myself putting off doing things I should be doing, like browsing through my phone. 
                    I learned from this chapter how important it is to approach time as an investment. 
                    I will benefit later if I invest more time now in learning, creating initiatives, and developing myself. 
                    I want to make weekly plans going forward to balance football, school, and personal time so I don't 
                    lose sight of what really counts.</p>

                <div class = "section-title">Summary</div>
                <p>This chapter emphasizes how the people in our lives influence our beliefs, routines, and prospects. 
                    While being with bad influences can hinder us, being around positive, driven people can help us grow. 
                    We must consciously select connections that uplift, test, and encourage us to become better if we want 
                    to progress.</p>
                <div class = "section-title">Reflection</div>
                <p>This struck a chord with me since I've been in the company of people who inspire me to set greater 
                    objectives and those that divert me from them.  I wish to spend more time with friends and students 
                    who share my ambitions and encourage me, especially in the field of computing. Creating the correct 
                    circle can keep me motivated and focused so I can overcome my uncertainties and anxieties.</p>

                <div class = "chapter">Chapter 7 - Be a Lifelong Learner</div>
                <div class = "section-title">Summary</div>
                <p>The chapter emphasizes that learning continues beyond school.  The secret to success and relevance is 
                    lifelong learning, which can be achieved through reading, training, mentoring, and new experiences. 
                    Constant effort and curiosity lead to growth.</p>
                <div class = "section-title">Reflection</div>
                <p>This is exactly in line with my computer journey. 
                    Because technology is changing so quickly, what I learn today could not be relevant tomorrow. 
                    I have to make a commitment to lifelong learning if I want to succeed in my work. 
                    This includes not only classroom instruction but also online courses, coding practice, 
                    and actual projects.  For me, it inspires me to see obstacles as teaching moments that 
                    make me stronger rather than as obstacles to overcome.</p>
